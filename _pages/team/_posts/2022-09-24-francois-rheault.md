My **research area** focus on the development of algorithms, pipelines and tools for medical image analysis. Specifically, my research interests are related to multimodal neuroimaging (including processing, segmentation, statistical analysis and scientific visualization). I have developed my expertise with the goal of better understanding neuroanatomy (primarily through brain connectivity), brain development, and pathologies relevant to clinical applications. During my graduate studies, I developed close collaborations with clinicians and neuroscientists and targeted my efforts to help them improve their technical skills and develop tools tailored to their needs. 

I am particularly interested in assessing algorithmic reproducibility, research replicability, and open source initiatives.


My **current projects** involve generating white matter parcellations based on cortical connectivity and diffusion imaging signal (using machine learning), developing neural network architectures tailored to structural connectivity matrices, and creating a new framework for longitudinal analyses of white matter bundles.
I am currently leading an initiative to create a new (open, accepted and community developed) file format for tractography (.trx). I also contribute to various open source software (Dipy, Nibabel, Scilpy).
