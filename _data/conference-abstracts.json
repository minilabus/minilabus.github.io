		"abstract": "The human brain is a complex and organized network, where the connection between regions is not achieved with single axons crisscrossing each other but rather millions of densely packed and well-ordered axons. Reconstruction from diffusion MRI tractography is only an attempt to capture the full complexity of this network, at the macroscale. This review provides an overview of the misconceptions, biases and pitfalls present in structural white matter bundle and connectome reconstruction using tractography. The goal is not to discourage readers, but rather to inform them of the limitations present in the methods used by researchers in the field in order to focus on what they can do and promote proper interpretations of their results. It also provides a list of open problems that could be solved in future research projects for the next generation of PhD students.",
